### Quick start

To create your own gallery, you can open this project in a [codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-from-a-template#creating-a-codespace-from-a-template-repository) on GitHub.

### <span id="setting-up"></span> Setting up a local environment

1. [Make a copy of this project on GitHub](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery/generate) (or download it)

2. Install [Deno](https://deno.com/runtime) (version `1.37.1` or greater).

3. From the root of your project, start a server for development...

```shell
deno task dev
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:4000`

_If you see an error related to [deno.lock](https://deno.com/manual/basics/modules/integrity_checking), you can delete this file at the root of your project folder (it will be created again automatically)._

### Creating a gallery

1. Add your pictures to the `_pictures` folder, grouped by album name

```
_pictures/
    your-album/
        original/
            1.jpg
            2.jpg
            3.jpg
    your-other-album/
        original/
            1.jpg
            2.jpg
            3.jpg
```

You may also want to delete the example pictures, and the LICENSE file:

```
_pictures/
    LICENSE
    northern-lights
    secret-recipes
    wildflowers
```

_You can also make [groups of albums](#group-albums)._

2. Add information about your gallery and featured albums to `_api/index.json`

```
{
  "title": "A name for your gallery",
  "date": "2019 to 2020",
  "albums": [
    "your-album",
    "your-other-album"
  ]
}
```

You may also want to remove the `japan` and `wildflowers` examples from the list in `_api/index.json`.

3. Create data and [responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) for your new gallery.

In the root of your project run...

```shell
deno task create
```

### Editing a gallery

You can edit the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files that were created for you in the `_api` folder:

```
_api/
    index.json
    your-album.json
    your-other-album.json
```

For example, you may want to change the `title` and add a `date` for each album:

```
"title": "A name for your album",
"date": "February & March, 2020",
```

To see your changes, you may need to stop the server (press ‚Äúcontrol C‚Äù) and then restart the server (`deno task dev`).

It‚Äôs okay to commit the generated files in these folders:

```
_api
_archives
_pictures
```

These files are your data and will only change if you re-run the `deno task create` script or edit them yourself.

_Running `deno task create` a second time will skip any existing files, even if 
they would ideally be updated‚Äìfor example, `.zip` files in the `_archives` folder. You can work around this by removing any files or folders that you want to re-create._

### How to add a new album

1. Add your pictures to the `_pictures` folder:

```
_pictures/
    your-new-album/
        original/
            1.jpg
            2.jpg
            3.jpg
```

2. Create data for your new album:

```shell
deno task create
```

3. Edit the data file for your album (optional):

```
_api/
    your-new-album.json
```

4. Add your album to the `index.json` file to feature it on your gallery‚Äôs home page (optional):

```
{
  "title": "A name for your gallery",
  "date": "2019 to 2020",
  "albums": [
    "your-new-album"
  ]
}
```

### How to publish your gallery

The `build` command will create a `_site` folder that can be published on any web server.

```shell
deno task build
```

You can browse the static site locally with this command:

```shell
deno task file-server
```

And then visit `http://localhost:4000`

You can publish your copy of this project to a static host like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com) using these settings:

Install command  
`npm run install`

Build command  
`npm run build`

Publish directory  
`_site`

To publish with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), you can skip a build step and use `server.js` for the `entrypoint`.

### Secret albums

If you want to publish an album to share with friends without making it public,
you can leave it out of the `api/index.json` file. That way, it won‚Äôt appear on the home page of your picture gallery site.

To make the album name hard to guess, you may want to include a [UUID](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=UUID+generator&t=ffab&ia=answer) as part of the name. For example:

```
your-secret-album-0c64f7ea-ad3d-4101-b379-fb5098aed301
```

You can also ask search engines not to index your album by setting `askSearchEnginesNotToIndex` to `true` in the `JSON` file for your album.

```
{
  "uri": "your-secret-album-0c64f7ea-ad3d-4101-b379-fb5098aed301",
  "title": "A name of your secret album",
  "date": "February & March, 2019",
  "askSearchEnginesNotToIndex": true,
}
```

This will add a [noindex](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710?hl=en) meta element to your page.

And you can ask search engines not to index your entire gallery (including the home page) by setting `askSearchEnginesNotToIndex` to `true` in the [_config.js](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery/blob/main/_config.js) file:

```
"askSearchEnginesNotToIndex": true
```

If your gallery is stored in a public place like GitHub, it may also be a good idea to [make your repository private](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories).

### Group albums

To group several albums together and show them on a single web page, create a
new folder using the name of your group‚Äìand place the albums inside it.

```
_pictures/
    your-group-of-related-albums/
        related-album/
            original/
                1.jpg
                2.jpg
                3.jpg
        another-related-album/
            original/
                1.jpg
                2.jpg
                3.jpg
```

And then visit `http://localhost:4000/your-group-of-related-albums/`

### Social sharing image

To make an [open graph image](https://ogp.me/) available for each page in your gallery, add your domain name to the [_config.js](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery/blob/main/_config.js) file:

```
"host": "https://your-domain-name.com"
```

### How to add a story about an album

If you‚Äôd like to include some words about your album, create a [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file with the same name as your album‚Äôs `.json` file and place it in the `_api` folder. For example:

```
_api/
    your-album.json
    your-album.markdown
```

Your story will appear along with the images, on the page for your album.

### Image captions

You can write captions and descriptions for your images by editing the data file for your album:

```
_api/
    your-new-album.json
```

```
{
    "filename": "44.jpeg",
    "description": "close-up of a tiny plant with purple flowers growing out of ground covered in pebbles",
    "caption": "Desert Canterbury Bells at Mastodon Peak",
    "uri": "44-mastodon-peak-desert-canterbury-bells"
},
```

The `caption` will appear as part of the [page title for the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title). And the `description` will be used as the [`alt` text for the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt).

You can also edit the `uri` to match your caption. This will appear as part of the URL for the image. For example: `https://pictures.tobbi.co/wildflowers/44-mastodon-peak-desert-canterbury-bells/`

If you have a lot of images, you may be able to get a head start writing descriptions by using something like [Azure Computer Vision](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis).

1. Sign in to your Azure account (or sign up for a new account).
2. Create a ‚ÄúComputer Vision‚Äù instance (or choose one you already have).
3. Copy the `.env-example` file in your local copy of this repo to a new file named `.env`
4. Edit the  `.env` file you created and add the endpoint and key for your ‚ÄúComputer Vision‚Äù instance.

If you create a new album, descriptions will be generated and added to the data file for your album. You can improve or make corrections to the descriptions by manually editing the file.

### Image file storage

You may want to use Git LFS, if your repository is getting close to 1 GB in size. See [GitHub disk quota](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota)

* https://git-lfs.github.com
* https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media
* https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#git-large-file-storage-lfs

#### How to move existing files into Git LFS

Here are some commands that I used to migrate large files to Git LFS, when they were already in my Git commit history.

```shell
git lfs migrate import --everything --include="*.jpg,*.jpeg,*.webp,*.avif,*.png,*.zip"
git status
git push --force-with-lease
```

And here are a few commands that I used to switch between `git-lfs` hosts.

1. Fetch images from a `git-lfs` remote host, replacing local pointer files

```shell
git lfs fetch --all
```

2. Upload images to a `git-lfs` remote host, using local image files

```shell
# Step 1: Push all commits, without uploading any large files
GIT_LFS_SKIP_PUSH=1 git push origin

# Step 2: Upload the large files for any commits that have been pushed
git lfs push origin --all
```
