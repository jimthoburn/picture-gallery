## <span id="automation"></span> Automatically creating and publishing albums

If you have a lot of images, you can automatically generate different image sizes and data for your albums and then publish them as a static web site.

Here are the basic steps:

1. Install Node 12.13.0 LTS or newer  
https://nodejs.org

2. Clone this project with Git (or download it)

3. Add your pictures to the `/pictures/` folder, grouped by album name

```
/pictures/
    /your-album-name/
        /original/
            /1.jpg
            /2.jpg
            /3.jpg
    /your-other-album-name/
        /original/
            /1.jpg
            /2.jpg
            /3.jpg
```

4. Add your album names to `albums.js`

```
export const albums = [
  "your-album-name",
  "your-other-album-name"
];
```

5. Open your project folder in a terminal and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

6. Generate files and start the server

```
npm start
```

7. Visit `http://localhost:5000/your-album-name/`

To stop the server, press ‚Äúcontrol C‚Äù

To start the server again, without re-building everything:

```
npm run serve
```

### Editing

You‚Äôll likely want to edit the files that were generated for you in the `api` folder.
For example, you can change the album names and add dates.

```
"title": "Japan in Winter",
"date": "February & March, 2016",
```

As you make changes, you can rebuild the site with:

```
npm run build
```

### How to publish your gallery

The above steps will create a `_site` folder that can be published on any web server.

For example, you can auto-deploy a GitHub repository to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and use these deploy settings:

Build command  
`npm run build`

Publish directory  
`_site/`

### Image file storage

You may also want to use Git LFS, if your repository is getting close to 1 GB in size. See [GitHub disk quota](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota)

* https://git-lfs.github.com/  
* https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media/


#### How to move existing files into Git LFS

Here are some commands that I used to migrate large files to Git LFS, when they were already in my Git commit history.

```
$ git lfs migrate import --everything --include="*.jpg,*.png,*.zip"
$ git status
$ git push --force-with-lease
```

## <span id="goals"></span> Project goals

This project is an experiment to see how easily the following goals can be achieved in a [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) single-page application on the web‚Ä¶

User experience
- [x] Essential content/features are available in any web browser
- [x] Browser features (like forward/back and bookmarks) are supported
- [x] Site is just as accessible as it would be with static HTML and page refreshes
- [x] Site is just as findable by search engines and [archivable](https://archive.org/) as it would be if it were made of static HTML pages
- [x] First page renders as quickly as static HTML
- [x] The application works well on a slow network
- [ ] The application has cues that are equivalent to a normal browsing experience, like a page loading indicator
- [x] The application is still usable when things go wrong, like if a CSS file doesn‚Äôt load or a JavaScript error happens
- [x] Gesture-driven animations and transitions between pages can be added

Editor experience
- [ ] Content can be created with a simple language like markdown
- [x] Content can be added, edited and removed using a simple mechanism like files and folders
- [x] The gallery can be hosted anywhere and kept private, if desired

Developer experience
- [x] The application‚Äôs logic is easy to understand and reason about ([Thanks XState!](https://xstate.js.org/viz/?gist=18995ef2fca6c1949991f21b1b68c6d0))
- [x] Large features can be broken up into smaller components and modules
- [x] Code for templates and logic can be used on the client or server side
- [x] The application can be continuously deployed in a way that is reliable, scalable and secure
- [ ] New features can be added with confidence that things won‚Äôt break
- [ ] The code is easy to read
- [ ] The app can be ported to another framework without too much rework
