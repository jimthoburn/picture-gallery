## Story

These photos were taken primarily in the south area of [Joshua Tree National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tree_National_Park)â€“part of the Colorado Desert.

The transitional part of the park where the Colorado Desert connects with the Mohave Desert turned out to have the most abundant wildflowers in the Spring of 2019. There were so many, the hills appeared green and gold.

_I never imagined the desert could be so lush and full of life!_
