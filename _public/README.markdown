# Add your static files to this folder

For example, this folder contains an image file with the following path:

```
_public/favicon/emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com-thumbs-120-twitter-233-frame-with-picture_1f5bc.png
```

That file will be available at a URL, relative to the domain where your project is running. For example:

```
http://localhost:5000/favicon/emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com-thumbs-120-twitter-233-frame-with-picture_1f5bc.png
```
